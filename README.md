Milestone Project 1 - Tic Tac Toe

This project required implementing core programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and user input handling to create an interactive experience. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of game logic, user interaction, and efficient code structuring.

Some key requirements for this:
 • We need to print a board.
 • Take in player input.
 • Place their input on the board.
 • Check if the game is won,tied, lost, or ongoing.
 • Repeat c and d until the game has been won or tied.
 • Ask if players want to play again.


Mini Project 1 - War
This project served as a stepping stone before I recreated Blackjack in Python. It allowed me to apply the same fundamental skills on a smaller scale, helping me build a strong foundation before tackling the more complex aspects of the main project.

Some key requirements for this:
• Card Class
• Deck Class
• Player Class
• Game Logic


Milestone Project 2 - BlackJack
The project required integrating multiple functions and using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to create a realistic experience. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of the mathematical concepts underpinning casino games, such as probabilities and rule variations like the Soft 17.

Some key requirements for this: 
• Create a simple text-based Blackjack game.
• The game needs to have one player versus an automated dealer.
• The player can stand or hit.
• Keep track of the player's total money.
• Alert the player of wins, losses, or busts.
